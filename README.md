  f. 	∑_(i=1)^n〖 1/i(i+1) 〗
2. 	Find the order of growth of the following sums. Use the Θ(g(n)) notation with the simplest function
g(n) possible.  Θ
  a. ∑_(i=0)^(n-1)〖 (i^2+1)^2 〗
  b. ∑_(i=2)^(n-1)〖 lg⁡(i^2) 〗
  c. ∑_(i=1)^n〖(i+1) * 2^(i-1) 〗
  d. ∑_(i=0)^(n-1)〖 ∑_(j=0)^(i-1)〖(i+j)〗〗

## Assignment 2
Design a divide-and-conquer algorithm for computing the number of levels in a binary tree. (In
particular, the algorithm must return 0 and 1 for the empty and single-node trees, respectively.)
What is the time efficiency class of your algorithm?


## Assignment 3
Design an algorithm to rearrange elements of a given array of n real numbers so that all its negative
elements precede all its positive elements. Your algorithm should be both time efficient and space
efficient.


## Assignment 4 (extra)
Let 𝐴 = {𝑎1, … 𝑎𝑛} and 𝐵 = {𝑏1, … 𝑏𝑚} be two sets of numbers. Consider the problem of finding
their intersection, i.e., the set 𝐶 of all the numbers that are in both 𝐴 and 𝐵.
1. Design a brute-force algorithm for solving this problem and determine its efficiency class.
2. Design a presorting-based algorithm for solving this problem and determine its efficiency
class.
